## Description

This project aims to deploy a simple clone of the AirBnB website - a complete web application that includes a database, a web server, web pages with dynamic content, an API, and a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface.

For the first step, we have built a command interpreter which is the first step to build the full web application.


## Background Context

The goal is to manage the objects of our project:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object


## Usage

```bash
$ ./console.py
