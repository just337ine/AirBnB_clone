## What is HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures content on the web, defining headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## How to create an HTML page
Creating an HTML page involves using simple tags to define content and structure. A basic HTML page includes an opening `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, an `<html>` element, `<head>` for metadata, and `<body>` for visible content.

## What is a markup language
A markup language is a system for annotating a document's content to indicate the structure and presentation.

## What is the DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

## What is an element / tag
In HTML, an element or tag is a fundamental building block, such as `<p>` for paragraphs, `<a>` for links, and `<img>` for images.

## What is an attribute
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are defined within the element's start tag. For example, `href` is an attribute for hyperlinks.

## How does the browser load a webpage
Understanding the browser's rendering process is crucial for web security. This includes steps like parsing HTML, building the DOM, and rendering.

## What is CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

## How to add style to an element
CSS is used to style HTML elements by selecting them and specifying properties like color, size, and positioning.

## What is a class
In CSS, a class is a reusable style definition that can be applied to multiple elements. Classes are defined in the CSS and added to HTML elements using the `class` attribute.

## What is a selector
Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style in CSS. Common selectors include element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.

## How to compute CSS Specificity Value
CSS Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied to an element when there are conflicting styles. It's calculated based on the combination of selectors used.

## What are Box properties in CSS
Box properties in CSS include dimensions (width and height), padding, borders, and margins, which determine the layout and spacing of elements.
